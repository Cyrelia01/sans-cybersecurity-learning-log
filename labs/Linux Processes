# Lab: Linux Processes

---

## Platform
SANS Academy system

---

## Objective
Understand how to view, background, and terminate running processes in Linux.

---

## Commands Used
- `top`
- `ps aux`
- `kill`
- `ctrl + z`
- `bg`

---

## Steps

1. Launch the `top` command: 'top'
2. Background the running process: Press Ctrl + Z to suspend top then 'bg' to send to background
3. List running processes: ps aux
4. Locate the top process in the output and identify its PID.
5. Terminate the top process: kill -9 <PID> (PID omitted intentionally)
6. Confirm the process has been terminated: ps aux

top is no longer running — success

---

## Observations
- Ctrl + Z suspends a foreground process.
- bg sends a process to the background.
- ps aux provides a full snapshot of running processes.
- kill -9 forcefully terminates a process and should be used cautiously.
- Process management is critical for system administration, troubleshooting, and incident response.
