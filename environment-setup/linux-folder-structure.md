# Linux Folder Structure Lab

## Overview
This lab is a basic SANS Academy exercise designed to refresh foundational Linux navigation skills. The focus is on exploring the filesystem and understanding the location of configuration files on a Linux system.

This exercise serves as a refresher from previous training while reinforcing good command-line practices.

## Environment
- **Virtualization Platform:** VMware Workstation 17 Player  
- **VM Network Mode:** NAT  
- **Operating System:** Ubuntu Desktop (likely 22.04 LTS)  
- **Desktop Environment:** GNOME  

---

## Objective
Explore the Linux filesystem and identify key configuration files located in the `/etc` directory.

---

## Steps Performed

1. Navigate to the root directory: cd /
2. List files located in directory: ls
3. Navigate to the etc folder: cd /etc
4. List files located in the etc folder: ls

## Observations

- All the configuration files that control the Linux system are located in /etc.

The lab reinforced basic navigation commands (cd and ls) and familiarized me with Linux filesystem structure.
No issues were encountered. This served as a refresher from previous training (UNLV bootcamp).

## Key Takeaways

- Basic navigation commands are essential for Linux system management.
- The /etc folder contains critical configuration files that control system behavior.
