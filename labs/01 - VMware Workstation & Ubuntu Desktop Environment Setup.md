# VMware Workstation & Ubuntu Desktop Environment Setup

## Overview
This project documents the setup of a local virtual lab environment using **VMware Workstation** and **Ubuntu Desktop**.  
The goal was to create a stable, reusable environment to support hands-on cybersecurity labs, practice exercises, and SANS Academy coursework.

This setup serves as a foundation for:
- Practical cybersecurity skill-building
- Lab exercises in a safe, isolated environment
- Experimentation with security tools and techniques

---

## Objectives
- Install and configure a virtualization platform
- Download and verify an Ubuntu Desktop ISO
- Deploy a functional Linux virtual machine
- Prepare a baseline environment for future cybersecurity labs

---

## Tools & Technologies
- **Virtualization Software:** VMware Workstation (or VMware Player)  
- **Operating System:** Ubuntu Desktop (ISO)  
- **Architecture:** x64

---

## Steps Performed
1. Downloaded and installed VMware Workstation from the official source.
2. Downloaded Ubuntu Desktop ISO from the official Ubuntu website.
3. Verified the integrity of the ISO file (checksum verification).
4. Created a new virtual machine in VMware.
5. Allocated CPU, memory, and storage resources appropriate for lab use.
6. Installed Ubuntu Desktop inside the virtual machine.
7. Performed system updates and initial configuration to ensure stability.
8. Confirmed network connectivity and basic functionality.

## Validation & Results
- Ubuntu Desktop successfully installed and booted within VMware.
- VM resources adjusted for optimal performance.
- Environment verified for use in future labs and exercises.

---

## Challenges Encountered
- Initial CPU and memory allocation required adjustment to balance host and VM performance.

---

## Lessons Learned
- Proper resource allocation is crucial for VM stability.
- Verifying downloaded ISO files is an important security practice.
- Virtualized lab environments are essential for safe, repeatable hands-on practice.

---

## Skills Demonstrated
- Virtualization fundamentals
- Linux OS installation and configuration
- Secure system setup practices
- Technical documentation and professional reporting

---

## Next Steps
- Snapshot the VM to preserve a clean baseline.
- Install additional security tools for lab exercises.
- Begin documenting hands-on labs and practice exercises in this environment.
