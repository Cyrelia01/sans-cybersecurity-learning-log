# Cybersecurity Learning & Hands-On Practice Log

## Overview
This repository documents my hands-on cybersecurity learning, environment setup, and practical exercises as I progress through the SANS Academy and related cybersecurity training.

The purpose of this repository is to demonstrate:
- Practical, hands-on experience
- Foundational technical skills
- Clear technical documentation
- Ongoing professional development in cybersecurity

This is a living repository and is updated regularly as new labs, exercises, and projects are completed.

## Who This Repository Is For

This repository is primarily for my own reference, learning reinforcement, and progress tracking as I build and document foundational cybersecurity and Linux skills.

It is also intended to be useful for:
- **Recruiters and hiring managers** who want to see practical, hands-on evidence of my technical learning, problem-solving approach, and documentation habits
- **Early-career learners** who are studying Linux or cybersecurity fundamentals and want real-world, step-by-step examples
- **Anyone transitioning into IT or cybersecurity** who benefits from seeing how concepts are practiced, tested, and reflected on outside of purely theoretical coursework

All content is written with clarity and transparency in mind, focusing on *what was done, why it was done, and what was learned*.

### Section Descriptions
- - **labs/**    
  A consolidated collection of hands-on Linux labs completed as part of SANS Academy coursework and self-directed practice.  
  Labs cover foundational Linux concepts, process and job control, networking, virtualization, troubleshooting, and package management.  
  Each lab is documented with clear steps, commands used, observations, and lessons learned.  
  *(No proprietary, exam, or restricted SANS content is included.)*

- **notes/**  
  Supplemental learning notes, reflections, and skill mapping related to cybersecurity concepts and career development.
