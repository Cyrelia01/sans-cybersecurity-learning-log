# Learning Notes & Reflections

This section contains supplemental notes, reflections, and reference material developed alongside hands-on labs.

The goal of these notes is to:
- Reinforce foundational Linux and cybersecurity concepts
- Capture troubleshooting thought processes and methodologies
- Maintain quick-reference material for commonly used tools and commands
- Reflect on lessons learned and skill development over time

These notes complement the hands-on labs in the `labs/` directory and focus more on *understanding, reasoning, and synthesis* rather than step-by-step execution.

Content in this folder may evolve as skills mature and new areas of focus are added.
