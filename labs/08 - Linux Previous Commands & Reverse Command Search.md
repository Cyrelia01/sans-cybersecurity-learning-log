# Linux Previous Commands & Reverse Command Search Lab

## Overview
This lab introduces methods for recalling and reusing previously executed commands in the Linux shell. Efficient command history usage is essential for productivity, troubleshooting, and incident response, where repeating or modifying prior commands is common.

This exercise covers using the arrow keys to navigate command history and using reverse command search to quickly locate specific past commands.

## Lab Source
- **Type:** SANS Academy Lab  
- **Platform:** SANS Academy hosted system  

---

## Objective
Learn how to:
- Reuse previously executed commands
- Search command history efficiently
- Modify recalled commands before execution

---

## Steps Performed

1. List the contents of the SSH configuration directory: `ls /etc/ssh`
2. List the contents of the temporary directory: `ls /tmp`
3. Press the Up Arrow key twice to recall the earlier command and list the contents of /etc/ssh again.
4. Initiate reverse command search by pressing: `Ctrl + R` simultaneously
5. Observe the prompt change to: reverse-i-search
6. Begin typing ls and observe a previously executed ls command automatically populate.
7. Continue typing until the desired command appears: `ls /t`
8. The command updates to: `ls /tmp`
9. Press Enter to execute the recalled command.

---

## Observations
- The Up Arrow key cycles through previously executed commands in order.
- Reverse search allows fast retrieval of commands without repeatedly pressing arrow keys.
- While in reverse search mode, typing additional characters refines the search results.
- Once a command is recalled, it can be edited before execution.

---

## Practical Tip

After recalling a command:

- Use Left and Right Arrow keys to move through the command
- Use Backspace or Delete to modify parts of the command before running it
- This is especially useful when commands are long or complex and need slight adjustments.

## Security & Operational Insight

Efficient command history usage is valuable during system audits and incident response, where repeating diagnostic commands is common. Reverse search reduces errors and saves time while working under pressure.

## Key Takeaways
- Command history helps speed up repetitive tasks
- Reverse command search (Ctrl + R) is a powerful navigation tool
- Recalled commands are fully editable before execution
- Mastery of shell history improves accuracy and efficiency
